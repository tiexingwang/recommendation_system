# Streaming Platform Movie Data Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth exploratory analysis of movie data from major streaming platforms including Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+. 

## Project Overview

In the age of binge-watching, users are consuming content at an unprecedented pace through various streaming services. With the flexibility to watch favorite shows or movies at any time, and on any device, streaming platforms are appealing more and more to modern consumers. 

This project aims to understand the viewing patterns and preferences of users across different streaming platforms. By analyzing movie data, we attempt to unravel insights about genres, countries, languages, IMDB ratings, and movie runtime that can guide content strategies for these platforms.

## Contents

This repository includes:

- Jupyter notebooks containing the detailed exploratory analysis.
- Python scripts used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- Raw and processed data files.
- An implementation of a movie recommendation system based on this data.

## Key Insights

We explored:
